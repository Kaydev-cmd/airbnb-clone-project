<p>
  A user friendly design is crucial in a booking system because it ensures that users can <br /> 
  navigate the platform easily and complete their bookings efficiently. An intuitive interface <br />
  reduces friction, helping users move smoothly from browsing to checkout without <br />
  confusion. This not only improves conversion rates but also builds trust by presenting a <br />
  clean, professional experience, especially important when handling sensitive information <br />
  like payment details. User-friendly systems are also more accessible, accomodating users <br />
  of all abilities and technical backgrounds. By minimizing errors through guided <br />
  interactions and responsive feedback, the design enhances satisfaction and increases the <br />
  likelihood of repeat bookings and referrals.
